   <h1> I love dogs</h1> 
   <h4> Why do I love dogs?</h4>
   <p> I love my dogs so much. I have two dogs. One is a Pomeranian and the other is a Yorki mix</p>
<p> Dogs are the best animals, they are always willing to love you unconditionally! That is why I love them</p>
<h1>Want to see some pictures of them?</h1></p>
